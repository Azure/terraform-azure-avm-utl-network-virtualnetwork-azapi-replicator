# This test case (basicList_query) is a query-only test case.
# It uses the 'list' block to query virtual networks, not create them.
# There is no azurerm_virtual_network resource to convert to AzAPI.
# The 'list' block remains in main.tf as it is a query operation, not a resource creation.
#
# Query block (remains in main.tf):
# list "azurerm_virtual_network" "test" {
#   provider = azurerm
#   config {
#     resource_group_name = "acctestRG-${random_integer.number.result}"
#   }
# }
