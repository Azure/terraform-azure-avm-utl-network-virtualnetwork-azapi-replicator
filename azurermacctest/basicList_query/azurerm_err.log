Test Case: basicList_query
================================================================================

Step 2 Failed: Baseline Validation

Failed Command:
terraform init

Error Message:
Error: Unsupported block type

  on main.tf line 44:
  44: list "azurerm_virtual_network" "test" {

Blocks of type "list" are not expected here.

Root Cause Analysis:
This test case is a query-only test case that uses a "list" block to query virtual networks rather than create them. The "list" block type is not valid Terraform syntax - it appears to be a testing framework construct that doesn't translate to actual Terraform configuration.

The main.tf file contains:
- Line 44: list "azurerm_virtual_network" "test" { ... }

This is not a recognized Terraform block type (valid types are: resource, data, module, variable, output, locals, terraform, provider, etc.).

According to the test instructions:
1. Main.tf is trusted and CANNOT be modified
2. This is Step 2 (baseline validation)
3. If ANY sub-step fails in Step 2, mark the test case as "invalid" and QUIT

Conclusion:
This test case cannot be executed as a standalone Terraform configuration because:
1. The "list" block syntax is invalid in standard Terraform
2. The azurerm.tf file confirms this is a query-only test that doesn't create resources
3. The test depends on resources created by the basicList() test case
4. Without modification to main.tf (which is prohibited), this test cannot pass initialization

This test case is marked as "invalid" because it's not a standalone deployable configuration - it's a query operation that depends on external resource creation.
